    <h1>Labour Force In Malaysia </h1>
    <p>
      In 2020, the number of people within the Malaysian labor force was approximately 15.67 million. The size of Malaysia's labor force had been 
      increasing in the last ten years.However there have been noticable increases in the Unemployment Rate as well. </p>

          The average for 2021 based on 11 countries was 7.48 percent.The highest value was in Brunei: 7.6 percent 
          and the lowest value was in Cambodia: 0.6 percent. The indicator is available from 2011 to 2021. On the right is a chart for 
          all countries where data are available. </p>

          Unemployment is especially hitting youth, with rates in southeast Asian countries on average three to
four times higher than adult unemployment rates (youth unemployment in developed countries is usually
1.5-2 times greater than adult unemployment). Part of the problem stems from demographic shifts in the
structure of the population and the fact that many of the jobs that formerly employed young people no
longer exist. </p>

          Employment by sector separates the working population of the country into three broad group of economic 
          activities: namely the agriculture, industry and services sectors. Employment in each sector is usually shown as a 
          percentage of total employment. These three main economic sectors can be disaggregated into additional sub-sectors to provide 
          further details following the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) System. </p>

          Although, women have increased their educational status and relevant skills in other to attain
higher employment standing like their men counterparts, the supposedly skill improvement has
not translated to job improvement and career prospects for women. 

        </p><p>Despite significant
improvement in cultural, attitudinal and childcare policies in relation to gender gaps from the
beginning of the century, female labour participation has been low even in developed countries
(Lagarde & Ostry, 2018).  </p>

          In an economy, human resources (labour) is the most important factor of production,
           other than capital and land, that in combination contribute to the output of goods and services 
           leading to the generation of income, consumption and trade.
        </p><p> To meet the economic growth aspirations 
           of the country, the strength, health and skill levels of the workforce are very important determinants. 
           In this context, the education attainment of the workforce has a direct role in shaping the skill level of workers.  </p>
